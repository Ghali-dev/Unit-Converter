Unit Converter 🛠️

I found this old little project of mine and decided to upload it for no reason in particular… 😌.

It's a simple Python unit converter that lets you switch between meters & feet, kg & lbs, and Celsius & Fahrenheit. Nothing too crazy, but hey, it gets the job done!

Feel free to check it out, mess with the code, or just ignore it entirely. Your call! 😆
